## 🔥 Featured Projects

### YouTube Chatbot (RAG over video transcripts)
Chat with any YouTube video in natural language. **GPT-4 + LangChain + LangServe + FAISS** pipeline with transcript embedding and semantic retrieval in a Streamlit UI.  
**Highlights:** smooth RAG flow, prompt orchestration/monitoring, fast semantic search.  


### Neural Machine Translation (English → French)
Bi-LSTM NMT with 100K sentence pairs (tokenization, padding, normalization). Achieved **BLEU 34.7** vs 27.2 baseline; **+18%** faster convergence.

## 💼 Experience Snapshot

**Research Assistant — University of South Florida**  
- Built an **AI resume optimizer** (GPT-4 + LangChain + Streamlit) that lifted recruiter-rated relevance **by 35%** across 100+ pilot users.  
- Shipped a **RAG system** with Hugging Face + OpenAI embeddings over **FAISS**; stored metadata/feedback in **Amazon Redshift**, improving personalization query speed **by 50%**.  
- Productionized a **GCP Composer (Airflow)** pipeline for **100M+** wellness-app reviews, cutting ETL latency **by 30%**; added MLflow tracking on GCS and boosted iteration efficiency **by 25%**.  
- Evaluated open LLMs (Mistral/Llama/Gemma) for large-scale sentiment classification to lower inference **costs by 20%** at similar quality.  
- Published **Tableau ↔ BigQuery** dashboards for sentiment trends, accelerating decision-making **by 15%**.

**Data Scientist — Tredence Analytics**  
- Deployed RF/TF models for subscription-growth anomalies; improved targeted conversions **+12–15%** via AB tests and cohort analytics.  
- Modernized pipelines with **AWS-powered ELT + Airflow + DBT**, improving reliability and reducing refresh times **by 13%**.  
- Standardized **experiment tracking** with Weights & Biases and **DVC** for data/model versioning; cut debugging **by 30%**.

**Data Scientist — Fratello Innotech**  
- Telecom churn prediction with RNNs/Transformers (BERT) + XGBoost; **+18% accuracy**, **−9% attrition** via retention campaigns.  
- NLP over **100K+** complaints (sentiment, keywords, topics) to surface churn drivers (**−12%** in prepaid segment).  
- Automated ETL with **AWS Glue/Lambda → Redshift**, cutting pipeline latency **by 13%** and ad-hoc turnaround **by 16%**.  
- Built **9–10 Power BI** dashboards (bookmarks, drill-throughs, tooltips) for self-service analytics.
